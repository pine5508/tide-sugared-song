For that reason, you'll find informative posts including DIYs and infographics on our social media sites to help guide you on your journey.

            At TrashIt we take trash and turn it into premium fertilizer allowing us to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. Our business is powered by the passion and ambition to make a real impact. Join us on our journey. Organic waste goes unnoticed in the clutter of plastic yet is inevitable. This waste ends up at the landfill where it gets trapped becoming a source of ground water pollution, disease and also releases methane gas. Efficient organic waste processing can reduce emissions,  recycle nutrient value, and capture energy. We take this massive wasted resource, and make premium compost from it for healthier soil. We have almost 1000 happy customers and community members. We empower communities to take responsibility for their waste.
