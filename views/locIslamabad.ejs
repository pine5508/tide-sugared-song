            At TrashIt we take trash and turn it into premium fertilizer allowing us to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. Our business is powered by the passion and ambition to make a real impact. Join us on our journey. We started our journey back in March 2017.  Organic waste goes unnoticed in the clutter of plastic yet is inevitable. This waste ends up at the landfill where it gets trapped becoming a source of ground water pollution, disease and also releases methane gas. Efficient organic waste processing can reduce emissions,  recycle nutrient value, and capture energy. We take this massive wasted resource, and make premium compost from it for healthier soil. We took notice of Karachi's garbage crisis and the valuable resources wasting away. And we decided to do something about it. That "something" started with a simple pitch at a startup competition, and 2 years later we have processed over 115,000 Kgs of organic waste into compost. We have almost 1000 happy customers and community members. TrashIt is changing waste disposal practices in Karachi by offering a sustainable, reliable and ethical waste collection and processing service. We empower communities to take responsibility for their waste.
